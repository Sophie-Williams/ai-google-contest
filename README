This is the bot that Jordi Chacon implemented for the Google Articial Intelligence contest that took place in autumn 2010.

The contest was about creating a computer program that plays the game of Planet Wars as intelligently as possible. I chose to work with C++ although I later realized that I should have chosen Haskell or some other functional language and everything would have been much easier.

Planet Wars is a turn-based strategy game set in outer space. The objective is to take over all the planets on the map, or altenatively eliminate all of your opponents ships.
